*Overview*
This project was developed as part of the Fuse 2024 Summer AI Bootcamp, where participants were challenged to create innovative AI solutions for specific industries. Our group was tasked with addressing a problem in the Sports and Entertainment industry.

*Project Idea*
We designed a player prediction model that analyzes the sentiment of a player's Twitter feed. The core idea is to assess how the positivity or negativity of a player's social media presence may influence their performance on the field.

*Key Findings*
Through our analysis, we discovered a correlation between player performance and the positivity of their Twitter mentions for certain athletes. This insight highlights the potential impact of social media sentiment on sports performance.

*Technologies Used*
Pandas: For data cleaning and preparation.
VADER Model: For sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) on the Twitter data.
